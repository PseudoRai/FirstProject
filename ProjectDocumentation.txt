USER ACCOUNT PAGE
--> member login
--> if yes 
	--> show account page
--> else
 	--> show register page
	--> email or username and password will be required for account registration(or username instead of email to keep it simple) 
--> account page will use get method to display specific user's info stored from the db
	--> info to be displayed on the user's account page are their: 
		--> Name: (or just display their username they use to login)		
		--> Item Name: (It will be empty for the first time they sign into their newly created account)
		--> Value: (current value of their item)
		--> message(or description about the their item, and any detail and info they want to add. It will be empty for the first time they sign in).
		--> Textbox: (a form with three input textbox fields labeled as "Item Name", "Message or Description", and "Value. Data passed through here will 
            then be displayed to user's account page. Either let users to enter new details on these input text boxes to edit/overwrite/replace their 
            "item name", "value", "message" again, or include an edit button right beside the displayed fields)
		--> search bar: (to search for a group they can join, using the provided group's password/code by the user who'd created the group.)
		--> search result: (the search's result will also be displayed in the account page since there will only be one group with the password/groupCode used to 			
            search the group.  Once the group is shown in the search result, there will be "view group" button-- to get taken to the group's page, and get more 
            details about the group-- it's where they'll also find the "join group" button a the bottom after checking out all the details about the group.)
		--> create group button: (to create a group)
		--> shuffle button: (greyed out maybe until the total number of members joined is reached? Or have this hidden, and then unhidden once max total of 			
            members allowed to join is reached?)
	 
CREATE GROUP PAGE
--> at this point, there are accounts and users already existing in the db, and anyone of these users can create a group.  
	--> Once a user have created a group, a code will be auto generated(some type of API 	can be used, or let the user create the group's password/code for 
        simplicity).  
	-->Info that will be required for the group's creation are: 
			--> group's name
			--> group's password/code(if another group already has the same password or code it will return error message to user to let them know it's already 
                taken/in-use)
			--> value(user will set the maximum item's value allowed, members who has equal or less then this value will be allowed to join. Otherwise, it will 
                return a message asking the potential new member to change their item to an item that has a value allowed in the group)
			--> total even numbers(only even numbers will be allowed) of participants allowed to join, so that each group members can be 				
                assigned assigned to one another evenly(by twos/couples)

GROUP PAGE
--> this page will display the following:
	--> a text display called "group created by": (displayed somewhere in this page will indicate who created the group(or leave this out 
        to keep it simple for now) 
	--> remaining number of slots available in the group: (lets users know how many more members are able to join the group)
	--> item's max value that is allowed: (let's the user know that they can join if the value 	of the item they listed in their account 
        is equal or less than the value of the max value 	of item allowed for the group) 
	--> "join group" button: (once join button is clicked, it will redirect user back to their 	account page. I Probably should add a display 
        text on the account page as well that 	indcates the group name the user had joined)
